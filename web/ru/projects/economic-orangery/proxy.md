We are proxy. We are not ghosts of globally projected avatars running
through fiberoptic cables. We are not zombiewave. We are the coming of a data corpse!

The word proxy derives from the Latin procurator, meaning someone responsible for representing someone else in a court of law. These days, the word is often used to designate a computer server acting as an intermediary for requests from clients. These servers afford indirect connections to a network, thus providing users with anonymity. However, proxy servers can also be set up for the opposite task: to monitor traffic. Proxy politics as the ‘politics of the stand-in and the decoy’ is characterized by fraudulent contracts, chimerical sovereignties and void authorities.

The flow of the meal goes from the high table to the low table, in this direction and not in the other. In the conversation with the proxy husband, I lost no attention from the others and no food. I was in the good position and the good direction.

Most of these initiatives are based on the idea of providing a proxy between the censored user and the content that they are unable to access. A proxy is an application that visits a requested website and returns the content. For example, if a proxy is running in San Francisco, a user in China can connect to the computer in San Francisco and request content from www.falundafa.ca. The proxy computer visits the requested webpage and gives the content back to the user in China. The ISPs and the national backbones between China and San Francisco only see the connection to the proxy computer, not the final destination, so the connection is not blocked.

Use a health care proxy, also called a Durable Medical or Health Care
Power of Attorney, to designate who will make medical decisions on your behalf should you be unable to do so; the designated person is called an agent or proxy. If you become unconscious, unable to communicate, mentally incapacitated, or in some way not competent to make decisions, your health care proxy or proxies will be empowered to make important decisions about your health care (including medical treatments and whether to provide or remove life-sustaining treatment, as well as who can visit you in the hospital).

Do we go to the market because we do not know what a thing is worth and we seize price as the proxy of value? In reality, we don’t value the thing, we just want it or want to get rid of it and the market is the only way. The next price builds on the market, on the price that took place before. The price that went before is the only value, yet it does not present the thing we are after in a larger frame or in a tribunal where its value is judged; it presents the thing directly, to be had or to be got rid of at that price.
