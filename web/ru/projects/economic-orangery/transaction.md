Saying ‘I am my private key’ is a reified and deliberately impoverished notion of individual identity. It frees individuals to not have to trust each other in their economic transactions, and so they can trust each other in their social interactions as a result.

Here a parallel can be drawn with the distributed architecture of the blockchain where trust is implicated by the transparency of transactions. In both cases clear sightlines function to produce self-regulating bodies.

Autonomous machine-to-machine transactions raise questions not only about security but also about cultures of exchange: Who wants transactions to be invisible or just ‘fade into the background’? And how might the material or psychosocial attachments people have with their possessions shape the nature of these transactions? Does your weighing scales or your wardrobe mirror put you in the mood to shop? Are you more likely to trust your fridge to authorize a transaction over your necklace, or your car?

Gifts are transactions that are meant to create or effect “qualitative” relations between persons; they take place within a preexisting web of personal relations; therefore, even the ob- jects involved have a tendency to take on the qualities of people. Commod- ity exchange, on the other hand, is meant to establish a “quantitative” equivalence of value between objects; it should ideally be done quite imper- sonally; therefore, there is a tendency to treat even the human beings involved like things.
