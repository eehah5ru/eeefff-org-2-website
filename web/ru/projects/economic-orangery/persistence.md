The adverb "still" can be used to indicate a similar persistence: After the bomb exploded, two pillars were still standing.

Memory can be short-term or long-term, phyletic or individual, motor or perceptual. Short-term and long-term memory is distinguished by the following characteristics: temporal persistence (how long a memory is retained); information capacity (long-term memory seems to have a greater capacity); and, finally, cue sensi­tivity (in which long-term memory retrieval is facilitated by a specific cue).

The exchange depends on the contingency of materialization or the persistence of both the contingent claim and money at the time of the exchange, yet we call the result a ‘value’, pinned on the notion of underlying state and the chronologic that corresponds to it.

The liveliness and persistence of the substantial core of these objects is then split into a thousand fragments: into infinitely fractionalized algorithms that enter the operations of programming.

The mutability of sexuality in an individual lifetime is an interesting and important question, however. Clearly, there are examples of both persistence and fluidity in sexual desire: for example, individuals who "knew" they were gay at an early age and remained so despite aversion therapy and incarceration, and others who "become" gay or lesbian at different stages in the life cycle in a manner suggesting internal change, rather than belated expression of "repressed" desire.

the question of persistence matters in a world of a globalized liquidity, of a bio-capitalized transformability, the world of the bio-capitalist appropriation and production of the forms of life. In other words, in a world where everything is supposed to change and to insist on change, it is urgent to ask the question what remains unchanged.

In the spirit of memory in popular culture, we end by returning to the Memphis nightclub with which we began: recently, a posting paradoxically called “Remembering Amnesia” shared recollections about the now-closed club, ending with an announcement that another club, called Senses, would host a “Retro Amnesia Night.” (Over)reading the names of nightclubs once more, we conclude that the closure(s) of amnesia can be at least partially undone by the persistence of sensual memory, which can invoke—without claiming to replicate—seemingly lost spaces and times “retro”-actively in the present.
