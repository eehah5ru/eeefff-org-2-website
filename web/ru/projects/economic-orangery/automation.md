encrypted fantasies and automated trust are not the only futures available for exchange, after all ‘the digital is a regime of energies’. The kauri is a currency between the tiny hollowed spaces and the ritual that favors the material transfer of wealth and non-automated trust, to instigate a brief moment of metastability, of deceleration.

In this enticing combination of network technology, cryptography and a systems-architecture-that-pays-for-its-own-security-through-some-basic-market-logics the idea was that we could get rid of the need for authorities, like banks, to guarantee relations and trust between people who don’t know each other, replacing such trust with cryptographic proof, and thereby run global money systems through networks of peers.

Bitcoin’s notionally trust-free system ends up demanding two different kinds of trust: first, faith in the algorithm itself, especially in its transparent underpinnings in the blockchain. And second, Bitcoin encourages participants to band together into computing collectives, creating a shared community around the arbitrary calculation of proof-of-work solutions.

Computation—as metaphor, method, and organizing frame—occupies a privileged and underanalyzed role in our culture.

Within this system, the worker increasingly becomes a prosthesis: rather than the worker animating the machine, the machine animates the worker, making him a part of its ‘mighty organism’, a ‘conscious organ’ subject to its virtuosity or ‘alien power’. Individuals are incorporated into a new, machinic culture, taking on habits and patterns of thought appropriate to its world, and are irreversibly resubjectivized as social beings.

Automation is both a reality and an ideology, and thus also a weapon wielded against poor and working people who have the audacity to demand better treatment, or just the right to subsist.

To fully automate capitalism — to make it a truly inhuman, machinic system — would involve not only the automation of production, management and co-ordination, but also the full automation of exchange. This requires the automation of the seller, the buyer and the payment process. This is the Internet-of-Things utopia of fridges buy- ing milk from passing drones. This is the world of toll-road payments automatically triggered by facial recognition as you silently drive by. The further you push this, the more alienated the individual becomes, a passive participant watching markets un- fold around them.

Machinic surplus-value production overall asserts greater and greater autonomy from its would-be human masters’ conscious control.
