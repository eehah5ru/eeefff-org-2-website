Different from the traditional concept of the working class, or ‘the people’, the multitude is more diffuse - its struggles could include identity politics, open access programming, and the living wage as much as factory working conditions. The concept of the multitude, which Negri took from Spinoza, crystallized at the same time as the first wave of the anti-globalization movements (ironically, given that Negri is anything but anti-globalization): one could say that Empire seeks to promote the glob­alization of the market (and/or the military industrial complex) while the multitude seeks to promote a truly open form of globalization: no borders.

And what if cooperation were a masturbatory cooperation and not the simple cooperation of brains?

Power — potentia — in this formulation is always the power of the multitude.

The proximity of work to pain is here specifically attributed to the massive hunger, sores, disease, airlessness, and exhaustion suffered by the industrial population, but all these conditions are in turn attributed to the more fundamental shattering of the essential integrity of act-and-object in the human psyche; for the body at work was separated from the objects of its work; the men, women, and children bringing forth out of their labor a multitude of objects (coal, lace, bricks, shirts, watches, pins, paper, plaited straw), them­selves inhabited a space wholly outside the realm on which those objects con­ferred their benefit, a realm that belonged to a set of people who had not themselves directly participated in the making of the objects
