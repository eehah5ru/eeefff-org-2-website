*Hi! Welcome on board of our synchronisation training program!*

*I'm Oracle, your personal assistant.*

*Do you know what synchronisation is?*

*Synchronisation is an arrow ↻*  
*An arrow from one point to the other  ↷*  
*Do you know what happens when arrows meet ⤻⃔  ?*  
*How do they move? ⤿⃔ *  
*What do you feel in those moments of meeting? ⤾⃕ *  
*⤻⃛⃔ *  
*Before start I gonna adapt the training program to you.*  

*I'll provide you with some exercises while you're walking to the starting point.*

*I'll train you in empathy, waiting, merging and (non)acquiring.*

*I'll guide you through hackathons and lunches, building networks and  business centres, glossy surfaces and cognitive work, mining crypto currency and time-travelling.*

*It'll be a dance of synchronisation with economical real.*  
*⤻⃛⃔  *  
*I'm building your personal route through infrastructure of a "smart city". *
