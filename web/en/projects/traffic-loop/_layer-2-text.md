#Instruction

Open google hangouts at 9 pm Moscow time. Start exactly at 9.20 pm. 
You should act according to this script. In case of difficulties you can ask other participants to help you out. 
If a phrase from your lines is not clear or you have to clarify anything, you can discuss a phrase, task or given instructions with other participants of the conference.  Do not continue the script unless every action of yours is clear.

You can agree with the other participants how to act in difficult situation that is not obvious to you.

`Actions – highlighted like this sentence – require from you not just reading, but acting accordingly. If it's written to tell a story then you need to invent and improvise it. There is no need to hurry. You can read an instruction aloud if it helps you to improvise.`

`Before start you need to choose a person to perform a role of the one who begins the conference. Everyone can try out and you decide who starts. This would be User 0.`

**User 0** `Say hello to the participants of the online-conference and then read the lines of User 0.`

**User 2** `Say hello to the participants of the online-conference and present a report on your deep emotional experience about a potential collision of the abstract Traffic Loop with the materiality of digital infrastructure at your work place.`

**User 2**  `Tell how the abstraction is materializing itself, how we can feel this materiality. Say a few words on abstraction violence that happens in the moment of its materialization. If you don't get the task, please ask others to help you out.`

**User 1** `Present your report on how you build an implementation of Traffic Loop as a part of your scientific work in the experimental datacenter in Luleå, Northern Sweden.`

**User 1**  `Tell a few words about the experimental datacenter using the info provided at the link:` [https://ice.sics.se/offer/facility-it-hw/](https://ice.sics.se/offer/facility-it-hw/)

**User 1** `Tell how this work continues your daily practices; why a testing mode is important for you; what are your feelings when you test anything that conflicts your expectations.`

`Now it's time for the participants to have a rest. You can do whatever you want. You can make a coffee or chat or anything.`
