# eeefff -> ru4real?

## Outsourcing paradise

**Conceptually** outsourcing paradise is a "working club" for people who don't have possibility to meet and share their experisnce because of the algorithmically organised devision of labour they are involved in.

**Technically** it is a generative narrative (built out of videos, css, jpegs, fonts and javascript) that uses "host" webpage to replace its elements with "parasite" pieces. 

More info could be found here [here](https://eeefff.org/en/projects/outsourcing-paradise.html).
