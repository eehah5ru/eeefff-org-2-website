On 3-7 February 2019 during [Decolonising Imagination](http://doxajournal.ru/events/di_school_en){target="_blank"} international research school at the health resort in Moscow region there will be a [working group about Error-friendly networks](#){.footnote-name data-footnote="error-friendly"} that the group eeefff is organizing. 

::: {id=error-friendly-descr class="footnote-descr hidden"}
Error-friendly networks is a practical group of juxtaposing a ready-to-trauma logic – borrowed from cybernetics with its positive and constituent role for error, pathology, catastrophe – and the notion of "effective computability" that dominates now in algorithmic-aided systems. 

The focus of the working group will be on different types of joints between algo-based entities and (non)human bodies as well as those energies that make those joints go-through-time. 

The goal of three workshop days is speculative constructing of algorithmically curated network topologies based on marginal cybernetic projects and what the group eeefff calls "holed futurism" that glues imaginations with the materiality of cultural machines. 
:::

[Here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2269041/error-friendly-networks/items/){target="_blank"} we try to collect and structure working materials that seem useful to us to unpack the theme.

This is a call for (bio)hackers, artists, technologists, philosophers, sci-fi writers and their inhuman collaborators.

Working languages: Russian, English 

Deadline for applications: 23.12.18
