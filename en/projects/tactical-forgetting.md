Tactical Forgetting is a computer-supported exercise that tackles the issue of digital memory and distributed events that need to be forgotten either because of their sensitive content, or because of community safety. Narratives unfold within different temporalities and spaces: documentary footage of the labor inspection in a large company in Minsk that develops military computer games, disappeared content from servers of internet portals, the distributed memory of bodies participating in the revolution, and fictional desired economic strikes. 

Exercises exist in two forms: [video](#video) and [training machine](#training-machine)

[Video](#video) screening was part of the [e-flux film](https://www.e-flux.com/film/){target=_blank} program [Mental Ecologies of War](https://www.e-flux.com/video/series/517391/mental-ecologies-of-war/){target=_blank}​.

[Training machine](#training-machine) was installed in Vilnius during [If disrupted, It becomes tangible](https://www.if-disrupted.lt/){target=_blank} exhibition and in Hamburg during [Antibodies](https://www.westwerk.org/antikoerper.html){target=_blank} exhibition.

![Here, the information is temporary — this is not a place of archiving — if you do not make it in time, you will not see it. The temporality that emerges from neighbouring chats continually re-actualizes the present, offering participation in the here-and-now. ](/pictures/projects/tactical-forgetting/tactical-forgetting-00.gif)

Computer-supported exercises are unrolled around digital memory and distributed events that need to be forgotten rather because of their sensitive content, or rather because of community safety.

You are up to explore a training program that is build around memorising based on neutron activity, that are fed with connected elements and various scenarios reflecting Belarusian reality. With your answers you define how hard you would will to remember or rather forget the materials you’ve just watched or listened to.

![The disconnection of the Internet has cut off from the usual distributed outsourcing work - there are no more craving voices on the other side of the screen. The ethics of personal contribution to production through agile team management methods can be forgotten, at least for an indefinite period. ](/pictures/projects/tactical-forgetting/tactical-forgetting-06.png)

![I open a chat that I haven't looked at for a week and think about how to quickly scroll through all these messages, how not to get stuck in past conflicts and logistical arrangements of the day before yesterday. A moment—and the chat interface will be scrolled on its own. Messages are automatically deleted. Parts of the chat interface begin to move at an inhuman speed, flying past me like blurred spots in 3D photograms that you “fly through” while moving between locations. April 14th. Then May 18th. And between them is there is emptiness. Only dates are stuck in the interface. This is automatized “tactical forgetting.” There are unsynchronized bodies left that only remember a few messages. Dashed memory of the bodies of those who look, read, observe, write, and act based on this unsynchronized thin layer of the present.](/pictures/projects/tactical-forgetting/tactical-forgetting-09.png)
