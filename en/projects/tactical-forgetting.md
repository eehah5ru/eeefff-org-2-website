![Here, the information is temporary — this is not a place of archiving — if you do not make it in time, you will not see it. The temporality that emerges from neighbouring chats continually re-actualizes the present, offering participation in the here-and-now. ](/pictures/projects/tactical-forgetting/tactical-forgetting-00.gif)

A moment—and the chat interface will be scrolled on its own. Messages are automatically deleted. Parts of the chat interface begin to move at an inhuman speed, flying past me like blurred spots in 3D photograms that you “fly through” while moving between locations. April 14th. Then May 18th. And between them is there is emptiness. Only dates are stuck in the interface. This is automatized “tactical forgetting.” There are unsynchronized bodies left that only remember a few messages. Dashed memory of the bodies of those who look, read, observe, write, and act based on this unsynchronized thin layer of the present.](/pictures/projects/tactical-forgetting/tactical-forgetting-09.png)
