![Recreational compound room that was transformed into dark room by us. Exterior view](/pictures/projects/mystery-covered-with-the-darkness/mystery-covered-with-the-darkness-01.jpg){class="first"}

During [CAMP AS ONE](https://www.facebook.com/campasone/){target="_blank"} â€“ the international self-organised grassroot residency curated by Masha Kotlyachkova â€“ that took place at the recreational compound in Vityazevo in Southern Russia, we made a dark room or "Mystery covered with the darkness".

Its rules were that even we don't know exactly what was happening inside of the room. Below you will find an instruction and some leftovers of shady affairs that were documented after those "dark sessions". And also an anonymous map ofÂ the room visits.

*Keepers of the dark curtains invite you one by one to the dark room.*

# *ğŸ‘€ Protocol for dark-comers ğŸ‘€*

*ğŸ‘€*

*The rules are as the following:*

*ğŸ‘€ don't tell anyone what has happened to you there*

*ğŸ‘€ when you are inside of the room, do not try to find out who is with you in it*

*ğŸ‘€ you cannot make video or take pictures*

*ğŸ‘€ you cannot spy with flashlights or other devices*

*ğŸ‘€ you cannot refuse an invitation*

*ğŸ‘€ after the beginning of the dark-session, any of the dark-partners can stop everything, carefully weighing all the consequences before that*

*ğŸ‘€ turning on the light is prohibited*

*ğŸ‘€ to be late is prohibited*

*ğŸ‘€*

# *ğŸ‘€ And here is the protocol for the dark-initiator ğŸ‘€*

*If you would like to make a dark session, then you write to the keepers of the dark curtains on eeefff.org@gmail.com or talk privately saying that you invite someone into the dark room at a certain time ğŸ‘€ The room will function from the 20th to the end of our camp.*

*The props and scenography of the dark session is limited by your imagination and the above rules.*

*After the keepers of the dark curtains receive a request for a dark session from you, they will choose a proxy-whisper to whisper to the dark-comer(s) that they are invited.*

# *ğŸ‘€ How do you know that you are invited to the dark room ğŸ‘€*

*Through a whisper in your ear. A proxy-whisper will come to you and whisper in your ear.*

*If you have just been invited to a dark-session, do not give the appearance that this has happened!*
  
# *ğŸ‘€ What is the role of the keepers of the dark curtains (that is, Dzina and Nicolay) in this? ğŸ‘€*

*They are the stewards of dark curtains.*

*They will glue all light sources and holes with black plastic-polyethylene or cloth, and finally they will unscrew all the light bulbs.*

*Between the sessions, they fix the darkness.*

*They organize an anonymous connection.*

*They choose a proxy-whisper to whisper.*

*They make sure that no one gets into anything.*

*dark emancipation*

*keep your eyes open, if you can*

*do not stumble on the shell of desires*

*guilty pleasure*

*what they do not ask, do not talk about*
