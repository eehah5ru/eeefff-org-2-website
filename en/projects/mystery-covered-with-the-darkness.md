# *ğŸ‘€ Protocol for dark-comers ğŸ‘€*

*ğŸ‘€*

*The rules are as the following:*

*ğŸ‘€ don't tell anyone what has happened to you there*

*ğŸ‘€ when you are inside, do not try to find out who is with you in it*

*ğŸ‘€ you cannot make video or take pictures*

*ğŸ‘€ you cannot spy with flashlights or other devices*

*ğŸ‘€ you cannot refuse an invitation*

*ğŸ‘€ after the beginning of the dark-session, any of the dark-partners can stop everything, carefully weighing all the consequences before that*

*ğŸ‘€ turning on the light is prohibited*

*ğŸ‘€ to be late is prohibited*

*ğŸ‘€*

# *ğŸ‘€ And here is the protocol for the dark-initiator ğŸ‘€*

*If you would like to make a dark session, then you write to the keepers of the dark curtains on eeefff.org@gmail.com saying that you invite someone into the dark room at a certain time ğŸ‘€ The room will function from the 20th to the end of our camp.*

*The props and scenography of the dark session is limited by your imagination and the above rules.*

*After the keepers of the dark curtains receive a request for a dark session from you, they will choose a proxy-whisper to whisper to the dark-comer(s) that they are invited.*

# *ğŸ‘€ How do you know that you are invited to the dark room ğŸ‘€*

*Through a whisper in your ear. A proxy-whisper will come to you and whisper in your ear.*

*If you have just been invited to a dark-session, do not give the appearance that this has happened!*
  
# *ğŸ‘€ What is the role of the keepers of the dark curtains (that is, Dzina and Nicolay) in this? ğŸ‘€*

*They are the stewards of dark curtains.*

*They will glue all light sources and holes with black plastic-polyethylene or cloth, and finally they will unscrew all the light bulbs.*

*Between the sessions, they fix the darkness.*

*They organize an anonymous connection.*

*They choose a proxy-whisper to whisper.*

*They make sure that no one gets into anything.*

# *ğŸ‘€ Conceptual basement ğŸ‘€*

*an affective darkroom*

*dark emancipation*

*keep your eyes open, if you can*

*do not stumble on the shell of desires*

*guilty pleasure*

*sensual deprivation*

*what they do not ask, do not talk about*
