It is 3014 year. There is no private property, there is no law, there is no institute of marriage, there is nothing. An ideal collective – people work together, eat, sleep, consume products of production, they are friends with bio- and techno-colleagues (animals, robots). All posts are temporary.

Quarantine brigades periodically find the capsules that were sent to them 996 years ago – in 2020. They have almost no information from this time, because at the time of the crisis of 2087 private companies deleted all data servers and everything was lost. What will the people of 3014 see there? What technology did people use almost a thousand years ago? What world did they live in?

Visual landscapes will guide you. It will be possible to interact with surrounding objects. Participants will investigate and try to live the present as unknown and unexplored, dis-habituate from the ordinary view on the technology, together we will try to time travel from the future to the present, we will disassemble the interfaces and protocols of the present into parts, we will try to look at the contemporary technological landscape together _otherwise_, take an active position, not being users, but operators, looking at the environment suspiciously, squinting, with an oblique look.
