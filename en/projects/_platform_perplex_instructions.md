I think of a driver.  
I focus on the eyes.  
The eyes are blinking.  
Our blinking is being synchronised with the leds of routers,  
Where an algorithmic geography of our time  
Is born,  
Where the distance is pulsating  
In tune with the results of computations.

As we in this car decrease and increase the gap between us.  
We are all forming an office on the highway.  
An emotional cluster.  
An emotional cluster without a permanent address.  
Standing on a road split between virtual and another virtual.  
I am inside a reservoir of computing  
And at the same time I myself am the reservoir.
