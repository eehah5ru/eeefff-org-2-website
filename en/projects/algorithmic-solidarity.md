# Algorithmic solidarity / The school of algorithmic solidarity

the series of collective experiments and situated experiences that seek to answer the questions:

- how to [read 44.71Gb](https://4471gb.eeefff.org/)?
- When the politics of the street intersects with the politics of digital materiality?
- What are the socio-political effects of algorithmization?
- Can we redefine algorithmization in socio-political terms?
- What are new forms of digital communalization that can emerge?
- At what public place the interfaces for social interaction could be discussed?
- How can we play around algorithms as tools for social imagination?
- What does it mean to define ourselves through the computing based processes when computing overlaps conventional cartographies?
- If we work from the network, we communicate using the network, why can't we use it as a tool for experimenting with new models of solidarity?
- What does it mean to be part of statistical fiction?

Please remember last time when you feel the brutality of mathematical models... their affectionateness... their ignorance

If you are asked to act, what action you'll choose: settling, parasitism, hacking, ignoring, crossing, violence against digital materiality?

Please draw here the relation between algorithms and solidarity.
