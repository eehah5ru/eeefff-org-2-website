# School of algorithmic solidarity

the series of collective experiments and situated experiences that seek to answer the questions:

- how to [read 44.71Gb](https://4471gb.eeefff.org/)?
- When the politics of the street intersects with the politics of digital materiality?
- What are the socio-political effects of algorithmization?
- Can we redefine algorithmization in socio-political terms?
- What are new forms of digital communalization that can emerge?
- At what public place the interfaces for social interaction could be discussed?
- How can we play around algorithms as tools for social imagination?
- What does it mean to define ourselves through the computing based processes when computing overlaps conventional cartographies?
- If we work from the network, we communicate using the network, why can't we use it as a tool for experimenting with new models of solidarity?
- What does it mean to be part of statistical fiction?

Please remember last time when you feel the brutality of mathematical models... their affectionateness... their ignorance

If you are asked to act, what action you'll choose: settling, parasitism, hacking, ignoring, crossing, violence against digital materiality?

Please draw here the relation between algorithms and solidarity.

## WHAT IS IT
_Algorithmic Solidarity_ focuses on the infrastructures of coloniality and the infrastructures of solidarity opposed to them. Specifically looking into infrastructural time, algorithmic abstractions and bodies. By form, it can be a collective experience / radical pedagogy practice / walk to the specific location / LARP protocol / digital togetherness / open-ended situation / affective temporary training zone. Each time one of the ??????????????ions is raised that forms the logic and poetics of a session.

## WHAT SESSIONS HAVE PASSED
At one session, we learned how to short the wires on the railroad tracks, at another we did a collective reading of programming code that relates to the extraction of profits from workers' bodies, to the rise of colonialism by the Russian Federation towards neighbouring territories, at a third session we had a training session on occupying the public media infrastructures. All these sessions try to relate to the intersection of oppressions: digital extraction, colonialism, media surfaces that do not belong to us.
