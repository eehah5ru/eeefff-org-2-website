I am concentrating on being relaxed and happy in this present moment.

My attention to the highway sound is growing.  
I like this sound, it is peaceful, deep and powerful.  
I feel the sound on a physical level.  
It brings me pleasure.  


I am focusing on breathing.  
On every breath,  
On every exhalation.  

[breathing]

My attention to breath is continuous.  
My attention is on the breath as it begins and my abdomen starts to expand.  
I continue to pay attention as my abdomen rises and falls with each breath,  
Like a person going high and low on a hammock.  
Going high and low on a hammock.  
Like a swing, my breath slows down at each end.  
I follow it all the way as it slows down, and starts again.  
I embrace my breath with all my care and attention.

Thoughts stay in the background.  
I enjoy the rhythmic rise and fall of my abdomen;  
I enjoy the elasticity of time.  
Its pulsation creating waves on the surface of data streams.

Data is pulsating.  
I choose words to describe what I feel.  
Looped structures come to my mind,  
Looped structures where  
The leaders mingled with slower runners in a circle type race.  
Fold into a mass or, better, into a cloud.

I try to imagine the sound,  
The sound of network infrastructure algorithms,  
Waves washed by a home wi-fi network.  
This silent accompaniment to the download indicator,  
Under which digital slips of my data  
Fly away into the cloud like a kite.

Into the cloud where the leaders mingled with slower runners.  
And where they pulsate  
In the rhythm of the contemporary economical real.

Electrical real –  
In the rhythm of transactions of exchange trade.

I imagine this transactional soup,  
Where reactions are ahead of incentives,  
And preemptive models of the future fragment my present,  
Creating in it whirlpools and fluxes.

My mind keeps producing thoughts.  
I do not follow the thoughts.  
I concentrate on my breath.  
I am comfortable and at ease.

I feel the presence of a person,  
Sitting next to me in the car.  
I sense the presence of her body,  
The frou-frou of her clothes.  
I concentrate on every little detail.

I see how the data flows wash our bodies.  
Data are fragmented,  
Like a spray of rain on the windshield.

We are scratched by the information.

With all my skin I feel the responsibility for the data,  
Which migrate through us.  
With inhuman speed.  
I dissolve into them. 

The frou-frou of the data scraping is the only thing I hear.

I open the window.  
The wind gently kisses my arms. 

I think of a driver.  
I focus on the eyes.  
The eyes are blinking.  
Our blinking is being synchronised with the leds of routers,  
Where an algorithmic geography of our time  
Is born,  
Where the distance is pulsating   
In tune with the results of computations.

As we in this car decrease and increase the gap between us.  
We are all forming an office on the highway.  
An emotional cluster.  
An emotional cluster without a permanent address.  
Standing on a road split between virtual and another virtual.  
I am inside a reservoir of computing  
And at the same time I myself am the reservoir.

We are all feeding the clouds the same way  
as we are heating the air inside the car.  
The driver is breathing out, I breathe her air in.  
Breathing out  
Breathing in  
Breathing out  
Breathing in

My ID-card is with me now  
I get it out of my pocket.  
I touch it.  
I feel its materiality.  
Shaggy surface.  
Gold embossment.  
Curved lines of a national emblem.  
Rounded edgings.


The driver has a biometric ID.  
I imagine how her fingerprints are conveniently settled  
Inside a chip.  
I imagine these sliding,  
Neon internal organs of the platform economy.  
Those data, my aggregated emotions,  
Which grease it from the inside.

I imagine a leaf of Aloe Vera.  
Its velvety lubricity.

I close my eyes and imagine this chip and a leaf.  
They are almost indistinguishable.  
Two surfaces of the same shagginess  
With the lubricants of our emotions underneath.  
Droplets of water accumulated on them.  
Sliding pairs of heated air.

This lubricity is an ambassador of new tactility of  
previously unknown citizenship.  
Citizenship of territories of computation  
that are fragmented and being continuously integrated  
by agile methods of software development.  
Flexible methodologies that require  
Constant embeddedness and creativity from us.

If I'm inside, I'm sliding,  
Appearing simultaneously everywhere.  
Both here and there.  
Both here and there.

I think of a driver as a platform worker.  
As an ambassador for this territory  
That cuts our desires and forms our speeches  
According to the pulse of the traffic lights of our cities.  
Here in the car part of the air was warmed up by her too.

I notice that a flash drive sticks out of the car stereo.  
The light-emitting diode is blinking on its transparent body.  
The flash drive is no longer a new one – the paint is coming off.  
For a year you have not been able to read the model and manufacturer.  
This body is a great place  
Where the virus installer could be hidden.

I am worrying.  
It seems to me that this is noticeable  
To those who look at me,  
When the car stops at the traffic light.

My body is becoming sweaty.  
Sweat like dew on the leaves of aloe vera.

I feel  
That now the driver and I are  
On one side of the barricades.

That now the driver and I are  
On one side of the barricades.

I am scared and at the same time I feel relief.  

My feelings grow from the wires.  
The wires going to the driver,  
Through our bodies  
Fermenting and mixing  
With cloud services on its way.


Focusing on my breath keeps me from getting lost in thought.  
I notice sounds and skin sensations without reacting to them.  
I smile at disturbances such as memories, little itches, and noises.  
I feel the smile on my face.


I imagine how the shy recesses of a small electric body  
Are being filled with the virus of tenderness.

Energy is flowing to me from these thoughts.  
I feel the power in this movement  
In this sliding which gives us the opportunity to hack.  
Space for thought,  
Not separated from the economical basis,  
which nourishes our thoughts.

[breathing]

I feel at home here under this highway.  
Here  
Next to the workers of the platform economies.
